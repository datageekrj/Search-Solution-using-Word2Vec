# Search-Solution-using-Word2Vec
In this project, I have tried to build a search solution which can be used by online book publishers and it can aid readers searching for relevant chapters by utilizing the semantic meaning in their query rather than exact matches. It utilizes tools like nltk, gensim and sklearn to build the model and get the top search results.
